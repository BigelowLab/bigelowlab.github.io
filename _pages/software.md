Here are a selection of tools, software and workflows developed at Bigelow Laboratory.


Data Portals (do we want to include this section?)
=========================
[ecocaster](https://eco.bigelow.org/)
Experimental crowd-sourced daily forecasts for jellyfish, deer ticks, moose, and other species.

[Environmental DNA portal](https://edna.bigelow.org/)
Data portal to view and download eDNA data from samples gathered as part of the Maine-eDNA project.



Software and Workflows
==========================

## Ocean 'Omics

[The GORG-classifier](https://github.com/BigelowLab/gorg-classifier)  A modification of the kaiju workflow that uses the GORG-Tropics database to annotate marine metagenomic reads. Created and featured for this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419312735

[sag-mg-recruit](https://github.com/BigelowLab/sag-mg-recruit)  A workflow for recruitment of metagenomic reads to single amplified genomes. Created for and used in this paper: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6366/1046.abstract
