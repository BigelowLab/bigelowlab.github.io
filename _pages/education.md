Computational data analysis skills are becoming increasingly important for our research. We are integrating these skills into our education programs.

During our [Sea Change Semester](https://www.bigelow.org/education/seachange/) we teach our undergraduate students a course on Oceanographic Data Analysis using the R programming language. We work with continuous CTD data, and discrete water samples, focusing on generating figures to show temporal and spatial change.

For our summer undergraduate interns we run a [Caf√© Code series](https://bigelowlab.github.io/cafecode/) where we introduce the idea of data science and oceanography through short presentations and article discussions. Previous topics have included: reproducible research, coding tools, introduction to R, high performance computing, data visualization, data repositories and experimental design.

Bigelow Laboratory is a co-organizer of OceanHackWeek, a hands-on workshop aimed at exploring, creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for large and complex oceanographic data. All tutorials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw20-tutorials), with videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6PlfxWZPLTPQ_OIr3dDPF9FRiHQXoVF).

We run [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) Style workshops for our staff, combining Carpentries lessons with [lessons developed in-house](https://github.com/cathmmitchell/plottingOceanDataWithR).
