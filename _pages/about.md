Computational and data science are transforming the way we study the ocean. The Bigelow Laboratory Data Discovery Initiativeâ€™s mission is 

**To use data science to integrate across disciplines in complex ocean systems science.**

We value 
- An interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to solving problems
- Reproducible, open access research methods & data
- Equity and inclusivity in our teaching and science practices

At Bigelow our expertise spans the data science continuum. We generate big, complex data sets through monitoring and sampling. We develop and apply cutting-edge algorithms to interrogate data. We build models and forecasts. All to answer foundational research questions and to create solutions to support society.
